export const cacText = (<Paragraph>The Congressional App Challenge is a nationwide competition that encourages students to learn coding and create their own apps. Participants can work individually or in teams to develop an app that addresses a problem or provides a solution. The challenge is open to middle and high school students, and winners are recognized by their local representatives in Congress. For our submission, we created an app focused on teen mental health awareness. Our app was a short mental health quiz that provided a tailored response based on answeres to peer-reviewed questions. See the qr code and images below for more information.</Paragraph>);
export const mcText = (<Paragraph>Mill City Hacks was a locally run hackathon originating from Mill City, Oregon. We submitted a project focused on giving motivation through a quote-a-day idea. See qr code and images below for more information.</Paragraph>);
